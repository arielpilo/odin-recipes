Hi there,

I think this is my third time doing this project. But this time I want it to be different.
Once I finish my project, I would like to come back to it and improve it, until I turn this basic project in something I'm proud of.

Skills to be demonstrated as of 6/9/2025:

-Put my HTML and Git knowledge to the test.

UPDATE 6/24/2025: I finished my webpage. It might not be the fanciest but I like it
