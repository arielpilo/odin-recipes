        <!-- Introduction -->
        <h1>Dubious Food</h1>
        <p>
            I think this is one of the most underrated dish of <strong><em>Breath of the Wild</em></strong>. It might be too gross to even look at, and the smell might be bizarre,
             but eating it won't hurt you...probably.

        <!-- Recipe -->
         <p>But anyways, despite it looks it can be eaten and it's very easy to make. You can use almost any ingredients you have on you, and I will show you how I make mine.</p>

         <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Ingredients</h2>
         <p>To make this delicacy we will need:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>A Mighty Carp</li>
            <li>2 Restless Crickets</li>
            <li>A cruelty free harvested bokoblin horn</li>
         </ul>

         <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Note:</h3> 
         <p>
            Almost all of the ingredients for this recipe can be found by exploring Hyrule, but for the purposes of these recipes, and the lack of motivation to work hard, Link bought almost all of the
            ingredients at the local stores of Hyrule.
         </p>

         <p>Execpt for the bokoblin horns. He...uh...happened to find those somewhere.</p>

         <!-- Recipe instructions -->
         <p>Now that we've gathered all of our ingredients, let's assemble this dubious thing.</p> 

         <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Recipe Instructions</h2>
         <ol>
            <li>Find your nearest pot and bring that boy to a boiling point of 750°F or °C and throw your Mighty Carp in there and let it cook for up to 10-12 business hours.</li>
            <li>Once your fish is fully cooked remove from heat and start shredding the meat with the bokoblin horn until you get a pixelated texture. Do not discard the bones. This will give the dish a better presentation.</li>
            <li>Optionally, get two dry restless crickets and break them down with your hand and add them to your dish. This will add a smokey flavor to your dish.</li>
            <li>Allow it to cool down and serve to your enemies or not so loved ones.</li>
         </ol>
