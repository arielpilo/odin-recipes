        <h1>Who is Link?</h1>
        <p>
            There have been many incarnations of Link throughout the Zelda series, but this time we'll focus solely on the <strong><em>Hero of the Wild.</em></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            This Link is not much different from his predecessors. In almost all Zelda games, Link is portrayed as a courageous hero, fiercely dedicated to protecting the Princess Zelda and Hyrule from evil.
            He's kind-hearted, often quiet, and refuses to back down from any challenge. Not because he's the chosen hero, but because it's the right thing to do. 
            But there is something compelling about the <strong><em>Hero of the Wild</em></strong> that I think is not often talked about.

            If we dig deep into the lore of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,</em> we learn that some champions and even the <em>Princess Zelda</em> herself at some point describe him as a stoic knight who has trouble
            to empress himself. Someone whose thoughts remain inscrutable for others. He rarely speaks, smiles, or shows emotion at all. But if we read <em>Mipha's Diary</em> we can see that he wasn't always like this. At the age of four,
            besides already being very talented with the sword, Link was also a curious and energetic boy with a ready smile. But at some point something changed. He became a knight and keeper of the sword that
            seals darkness, but also someone that would hardly speak, and smile even more rarely. He became someone that resembles more the Link some champions described, and the one we see in Link's memories.
