        <h1>Who is Link?</h1>
        <p>
            There have been many incarnations of Link throughout the Zelda series, but this time we'll focus solely on the <strong><em>Hero of the Wild.</em></strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            This Link isn't much different from his predecessors. Like in most games in the franchise, he's portrayed as a courageous hero, fiercely dedicated to protecting Princess Zelda
            and the land of Hyrule from evil. He's kind-hearted, often quiet, and refuses to back down from any challenge — not because he's the chosen hero, but because it's the right thing to do.
            But there's something compelling about the Hero of the Wild that I think isn't often talked about.
        </p>

        <p>
            If we dig into the lore of <em>Breath of the Wild,</em> we learn that some champions — and even <em>Princess Zelda herself</em> — describe him as a stoic knight who has trouble expressing himself.
            Someone whose thoughts remain a mystery. He rarely speaks, smiles, or shows emotion at all. But if we read Mipha's Diary, we see Link wasn't always like this. At just four years old — 
            besides already being very talented with a sword — he was also a curious, energetic boy with a ready smile. But at some point, something changed. He became a knight and the keeper of <em>the sword that seals the darkness…</em> 
            but also someone who would hardly speak, and smile even less often. And there's a reason behind it.
        </p>

        <p>
            Link is burdened with the great task of being Hyrule's heroe, bearer of the sword that seals darkness, and Princess Zelda's protector. With so much at stake and so many eyes upon him, Link
            feels it necessary to stay strong and silently bear any burden. This led him to stop outwardly expressing his thoughts and feelings. He became the stoic, seemingly emotionless knight we see in Link's memories.
            But when Link awakens after 100 years of slumber, he loses his memories. He doesn't remember who he is, his role, or any of his past burdens. That's why the Link we play as feels different than the one we see in the memories or learn about in the diaries of the champions.
            He is still quiet and a bit inexpressive, but when he <strong>does</strong> show his emotions, it's like we are able to see that curious and energetic boy again. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            We all have struggles that go unseen by others, and sometimes we are so absorbed with our own problems that we fail to see others struggling too. I wonder, if we were all to suddenly forget all of our memories, would we be more like Link?
            I'm sure we would be confused, and even maybe scared for a moment, but would the burdens and the demons that haunts us also go away?.
        </p>

        <p>
            I know we can't escape our problems, and as long as we live we will struggle. But I also think that sometimes, we are so focused on <strong>surviving</strong> our battles that we forget the most important thing in this life:
            to simply <strong>live.</strong> Enjoy the little things and precious moments this life has to offer. They might not make the pain or problems vanish, but they will help us keep moving forward. In the end, those moments are the ones that make the battles worth the fighting and the struggle.
        </p>

            Link has always been my favorite character of all time. Since I was little, I enjoyed playing <em>Zelda</em> games, and I've always admired Link. He always seemed so courageous, and strong no matter what. But when <em>Breath of the Wild</em> came out, I felt like I resonated with Link.
            Not because his strentgh or courage, or even his beautiful hair and sky-blue eyes, but because even <em>he</em> struggles. I resonate with his silence, his fear of not being up to the expectation, and in his refusal to stop moving forward no matter what. Maybe you can see yourself through Link too or perhaps
            another charater or real person?
