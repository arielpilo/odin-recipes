            Throughout the whole Zelda series, there's been many Links with slighly different characteristics, but they all share some things in common. They are extremely brave and stoic, humble, and
            caring towards others. They are also the heroes in charge of protecting the land of Hyrule from evil forces. All Zelda games portray Link as the perfect hero. Fearless, humble and just.
            Someone that will protect and fight for what is right and show little to no emotion while doing so. Some might admire this kind of behavior and would want to be like Link, but the truth is 
            that Link is no different than us. He has his own worries and sturggles that go unseen by others, just like we do. He finds it necessary to be strong and siletnly bear his burdens.
            Being the last line of defense of Hyrule and bearer of the Master Sword, is not an easy task
